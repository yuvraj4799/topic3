    <p><i><b>"Yuvraj Bansal here; nice to meet you all. I'm 19 Year's old. I'm a Chandigarh native. Both my 10th and
                12th
                grades were earned in Chandigarh, at St. Stephen's School and GMSSS 37B, respectively. I'm presently
                pursuing a BTech degree at Chitkara University with a focus in software engineering. I enjoy playing
                cricket, listening to music, and learning new things in the technology world. My goal is to serve as a
                source of inspiration for others."</b></i></p>
